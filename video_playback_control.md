- *Subset Sum Problem:* This algorithm can be utilized to efficiently manage video playback control options such as fast-forwarding or rewinding to a specific timestamp, ensuring smooth and precise navigation within the video.

- *Dynamic Programming - Minimum Number of Jumps:* Useful for implementing features like skipping to the next or previous video in a playlist based on user preferences and behavior.

- *XOR Operations (the 3 major cases of duplicates and unique):* XOR operations can help optimize video playback by efficiently detecting and handling duplicate or unique video segments, ensuring a seamless viewing experience without redundancy.
